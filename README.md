# Exploratory-Datasets
One should focus more on data not algorithm

After finished my courses, and having some tests, I conclude that cleaning the data and make them ready for machine learning is very much important. 
In EDA we should focus on analyzing, not deleting or removing features.
And In this repository I tried to practice some of experiments with the different different datasets.
My purpose here is, I want to be an expert on cleaning data, and understand every single feature in datasets, comparing from one and other.
